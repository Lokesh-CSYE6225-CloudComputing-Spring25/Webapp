How to Run the Application
## Overview
This is a Flask-based web application with a simple `/healthz` endpoint to perform health checks and interact with a MySQL database. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and provides a scalable, modular structure.

---

## Features
- Flask-based application with Blueprints for modular routing.
- `/healthz` endpoint for health checks.
- SQLAlchemy integration for database interactions.
- Secure credential handling using `.env` files.
- Auto-database creation if not present.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- MySQL database
- Pip for managing Python packages

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Webapp
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add your database credentials:
   ```
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

---

## Configuration
The database URL is defined in `app/config.py`. By default:
```python
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_NAME = "healthcheck"
```
The app dynamically injects `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` from the `.env` file.

---

## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
   ```

---

## API Endpoints

### **GET /healthz**
- **Description**: Performs a health check by interacting with the database.
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: Database is healthy.
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: Database connection failed.
- **Headers**:
  - `Cache-Control`: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: `nosniff`

---

## Deployment
For deployment:
1. Set the environment variable `FLASK_ENV=production`.
2. Use a production-ready server like `gunicorn`:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 run:app
   ```

---

## Testing
You can test the `/healthz` endpoint with tools like `curl` or Postman:
1. Using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
   ```

2. Using Postman:
   - Set method to `GET`.
   - Enter the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz`.
   - Send the request and check the response.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify credentials in `.env`.
- Ensure the MySQL service is running and accessible.
- Check the database URL in `config.py`.

### Missing Dependencies
- Ensure all dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Debugging

Perfect ‚Äî thanks for sharing both the Terraform and WebApp README content! You've done an excellent job organizing them.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do next:

1. **Terraform README**  
   ‚úÖ Already looks complete and well-written. No edits needed unless you‚Äôd like to update it for Assignment 6-specific logging/metrics changes.

2. **WebApp README**  
   I‚Äôll now create a new **section specifically for Assignment 6** and append it at the end of your current WebApp README (without merging into other sections). This section will document:

   - CloudWatch logging setup
   - Custom metrics tracking (API, DB, S3)
   - IAM + CloudWatch agent configuration
   - Any testing instructions to verify logs and metrics

Give me one moment to prepare that for you.

Here‚Äôs the new **Assignment 6** section you can append at the bottom of your existing **WebApp README.md** file:

---

## üì¶ Assignment 6 ‚Äì Logging, Metrics, and CloudWatch Integration

### üìù Overview

This assignment focuses on:
- CloudWatch Agent setup via Packer
- Logging application events to AWS CloudWatch
- Sending custom metrics for API, database, and S3 usage
- IAM configuration for secure monitoring

---

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ **CloudWatch Agent installed via Packer image**
- ‚úÖ **CloudWatch config copied to `/opt/csye6225/cloudwatch-config.json`**
- ‚úÖ **Custom metrics sent via `statsd`**
- ‚úÖ **Application logs written to `/var/log/csye6225/webapp.log`**
- ‚úÖ **IAM Role with necessary CloudWatch and Logs permissions**
- ‚úÖ **User data script configures and starts agent on boot**

---

### üìÑ CloudWatch Agent Configuration

Located at:  
```bash
/opt/csye6225/cloudwatch-config.json
```

Key features:
- Collects logs from `/var/log/csye6225/webapp.log`
- Uses `statsd` for metrics (API count, timing, DB/S3 ops)
- Pushes logs to CloudWatch log group:  
  **`csye6225-webapp-logs`**

---

### üìä Custom Metrics Tracked

| Metric Name               | Description                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `api.healthz.count`      | Number of `/healthz` calls                    |
| `api.file_upload.count`  | Number of file uploads                        |
| `api.file_get.count`     | Number of file metadata fetch requests        |
| `api.file_delete.count`  | Number of file deletions                      |
| `api.<endpoint>.time`    | Total request time per endpoint (ms)          |
| `db.<op>.time`           | Time taken for DB operations (ms)             |
| `s3.<op>.time`           | Time taken for S3 upload/delete (ms)          |

StatsD runs on default port `8125`.

---

### üîê IAM Role Permissions

Terraform provisions an IAM role attached to EC2:
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`
- `logs:CreateLogStream`
- `logs:PutLogEvents`
- `logs:DescribeLogStreams`
- `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`
- `s3:*` (scoped to specific bucket)

---

### üöÄ Deployment Notes

- On EC2 boot, `cloudwatch-config.json` is loaded via:
```bash
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/csye6225/cloudwatch-config.json -s
```

- The `setup_webapp.sh` script automatically configures and starts the agent **only on AWS instances** (detected using instance metadata).

---

### üîç Verification Steps

1. **Check Logs**:
   - Navigate to **CloudWatch > Log groups > csye6225-webapp-logs**
   - Look for new log streams per instance

2. **Check Metrics**:
   - Go to **CloudWatch > Metrics > Custom namespaces**
   - Select namespace: `statsd` or `CWAgent`
   - View graphs for API timings, counts, etc.

---

### üß™ Testing

Use `curl` or Postman to hit various endpoints:
```bash
curl -X GET http://<your-domain>:8080/healthz
curl -X POST http://<your-domain>:8080/v1/file -F "profilePic=@test.jpg"
curl -X GET http://<your-domain>:8080/v1/file/<file_id>
curl -X DELETE http://<your-domain>:8080/v1/file/<file_id>
```

Then validate:
- Logs are updated in CloudWatch
- Metrics show increments & timings under the custom namespace
