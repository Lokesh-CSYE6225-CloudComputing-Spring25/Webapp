How to Run the Application
## Overview
This is a Flask-based web application with a simple `/healthz` endpoint to perform health checks and interact with a MySQL database. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and provides a scalable, modular structure.

---

## Features
- Flask-based application with Blueprints for modular routing.
- `/healthz` endpoint for health checks.
- SQLAlchemy integration for database interactions.
- Secure credential handling using `.env` files.
- Auto-database creation if not present.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- MySQL database
- Pip for managing Python packages

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Webapp
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add your database credentials:
   ```
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

---

## Configuration
The database URL is defined in `app/config.py`. By default:
```python
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_NAME = "healthcheck"
```
The app dynamically injects `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` from the `.env` file.

---

## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
   ```

---

## API Endpoints

### **GET /healthz**
- **Description**: Performs a health check by interacting with the database.
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: Database is healthy.
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: Database connection failed.
- **Headers**:
  - `Cache-Control`: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: `nosniff`

---

## Deployment
For deployment:
1. Set the environment variable `FLASK_ENV=production`.
2. Use a production-ready server like `gunicorn`:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 run:app
   ```

---

## Testing
You can test the `/healthz` endpoint with tools like `curl` or Postman:
1. Using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
   ```

2. Using Postman:
   - Set method to `GET`.
   - Enter the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz`.
   - Send the request and check the response.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify credentials in `.env`.
- Ensure the MySQL service is running and accessible.
- Check the database URL in `config.py`.

### Missing Dependencies
- Ensure all dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Debugging
- Enable Flask debug mode during development:
  ```python
  app.run(debug=True)
  ```

---

## Notes
- Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to secure sensitive credentials.
- Default credentials in `config.py` can be overridden by environment variables.

## **Deployment on Ubuntu Droplet**
1. Connect to the server via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/do root@<droplet-ip>
   ```
2. Copy the zipped web application and shell script using SCP:
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/do Webapp.zip setup_script.sh root@<droplet-ip>:/root/
   ```
3. Run the shell script to set up the application:
   ```bash
   sudo bash setup_script.sh
   ```
4. Verify that MySQL is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status mysql
   ```
5. Verify that Python is installed and running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
6. Navigate to the application directory:
   ```bash

   ```
7. Create a virtual environment and `.env` file (if pulled from GitHub):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   touch .env
   ```
8. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
9. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
10. Start the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
11. Stop the app and run tests:
    ```bash
    pkill -f run.py  # Stops the running Flask application
    pytest tests/
    ```
12. Allow external access to port 8080:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
    ```
13. Test the API from your local machine:
    ```bash
    curl -i http://<droplet-ip>:8080/healthz

Assignment 3

üìù Overview

Assignment 3 focuses on implementing Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions for the Web App.

üìö Steps Completed

üëâ Created and configured GitHub Actions workflow for Web App CI/CDüëâ Implemented automated testing using pytestüëâ Configured branch protection rules to enforce CI checks before merging PRsüëâ Ensured CI runs on every pull request to validate changes

## Web App CI/CD Pipeline
- Runs pytest to validate API functionality.
- Ensures /healthz endpoint behaves correctly.
- Blocks PR merges if any tests fail.
---
## Branch Protection Rules
1. Require status checks before merging
   - Web App CI must pass before merging.
2. Require branches to be up-to-date before merging
   - Ensures branches are synced with the latest code.
   
3. No direct commits to main branch
   - Changes must go through PRs with CI/CD validation.

## **WebApp Setup on Server**
### **Automated Deployment Using `setup_webapp.sh`**
This script performs the following actions:
- Installs **MySQL, Python, pip, nginx**.
- Sets up MySQL authentication & creates a database.
- Extracts WebApp files & sets up a virtual environment.
- Moves `.env` securely & installs dependencies.
- Configures **systemd service for WebApp**.

### **Deployment Steps**
1. Copy `setup_webapp.sh` & `Webapp.zip` to the server:
   ```sh
   scp setup_webapp.sh Webapp.zip user@server-ip:/tmp/
   ```
2. SSH into the server:
   ```sh
   ssh user@server-ip
   ```
3. Run the setup script:
   ```sh
   sudo bash /tmp/setup_webapp.sh
   ```
4. Verify systemd service status:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status systemd_webapp
   ```

---

## **API Endpoints**
### **GET /healthz**
- **Description**: Performs a health check by interacting with the database.
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: Database is healthy.
  - `503 Service Unavailable`: Database connection failed.
- **Headers**:
  - `Cache-Control`: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: `nosniff`

---

## **Systemd Service Management**
The WebApp runs as a **systemd service**, ensuring automatic startup and crash recovery.

### **Useful Commands:**
- Start the service:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start systemd_webapp
  ```
- Restart the service:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart systemd_webapp
  ```
- Check logs:
  ```sh
  journalctl -u systemd_webapp --no-pager | tail -50
  ```

---

## **Testing & Troubleshooting**
### **Health Check API (`/healthz`)**
- Test via `curl`:
  ```sh
  curl -X GET http://<server-ip>:8080/healthz
  ```

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
**1. MySQL Connection Issues**
   - Ensure MySQL is running:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl status mysql
     ```
   - Verify credentials in `.env`.

**2. WebApp Not Running**
   - Restart the systemd service:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl restart systemd_webapp
     ```
   - Check logs:
     ```sh
     journalctl -u systemd_webapp --no-pager | tail -50
     ```

---

## **üöÄ Conclusion**
This WebApp setup ensures a **scalable, production-ready Flask application** with **automated deployment** and **systemd service management**. üéØ
